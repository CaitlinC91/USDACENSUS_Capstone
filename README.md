USDA Census Capstone

Capstone project for Nashville Software School DA8. 

This capstone attempts to understand crop yields reported in the USDA Census and find a correlation between yields and weather patterns.

Motivation
Climate change presents a real and significant impact to many parts of our lives. I was curious about digging into some weather data to get a hands on feel for some of the changes and effects we may be seeing.
	Crop production is vital for survival of all societies, and I wanted to see how the US may have been handling some weather effects so far.

Data Sources
USDA Census: USDA - National Agricultural Statistics Service - Census of Agriculture
Weather: Compiled historical daily temperature and precipitation data for selected 210 U.S. cities (cmu.edu)

Tools
Python/Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and Tableau for visualizations
